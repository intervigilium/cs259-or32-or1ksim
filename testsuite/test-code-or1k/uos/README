		       Or1ksim Test Suite: uOS Micro OS
		       ================================

This is the Micro OS (uOS) developed by Damjan Lampret. At present the code
builds, but there is no suitable Or1ksim configuration.

ORIGINAL README
===============

This is the Micro OS (uOS) for testing operating system features of OpenRISC
1000 architecture. Specifically non reentrant, preemptive multitasking
microkernel. Purpose of this code is not to be a true operating system but
merely a testbench for testing the architecture, or1ksim and software
development tools (GCC, Binutils, ...).

This test OS has all necessary exception handlers to handle exceptions. There
are two tasks: one task generates data and passes that data via IPC to the
second task. Second task outputs the data via or1ksim syscall to the
simulator.

Currently only OR32 is supported (exception handlers are written in
assembly). Tools required to compile sources are the latest or32-coff-gcc,
or32-coff-as and or32-coff-ld. Also make sure you undefine
VIRTUAL_MACHINE_ONLY when compiling or1ksim.
