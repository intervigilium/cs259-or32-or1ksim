	      Or1ksim: The OpenRISC 1000 Architectural Simulator
	      ==================================================


What is this stuff?
===================

This is OpenRISC 1000 architectural simulator. See the file COPYING
for copying permission. To contact the authors, see the AUTHORS file.

This simulator loads an assembly file for one of the both architectures
and it simulates the operation of instructions. 


Pre-requisites
==============

The GNU toolchain for OpenRISC 1000 is required to compile programs for use
with Or1ksim. Instructions how to build these GNU tools can be found on
www.opencores.org

Both the tool chain and DejaGnu are need to run the test suite.


Installation
============

See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions. Full details are
in the user guide, which can be found in the 'doc' subdirectory.


GNU Tools
=========

Instructions how to build GNU tools can be found on www.opencores.org, or in
the Embecosm Application Note EAN2: "The OpenCores OpenRISC 1000 Simulator and
Tool Chain: Installation Guide" <www.embecosm.com/download/ean2.html>.


Simulator test
==============

Or1ksim can be tested with "make check", but this requires the GNU tool chain
to be installed (using the same target specification) and DejaGNU to be
installed. Full details of the tests can be found in the 'testsuite'
sub-directory.


Help
====

Run sim with --help option for list of command line options and help in
interactive mode, to list the commands.

A user guide may be found in the 'doc' sub-directory.

If doxygen and dot are installed, structured documentation of the code base
may be obtained by running the command:

  doxygen doxygen.config

from the top level directory.


OpenRISC and OpenCores
======================

This project is licensed under the GNU Public License version 3. See the file
COPYING for details.

About the same idea as with GNU project except we want free and open source
IP (intellectual property) cores. We design open source, synthesizable
cores. OpenRISC is one such core. It is a 32-bit RISC microprocessor that
will run GNU/Linux.
